Metagenomics Utility Python Scripts
--------------------------------------------------
In this repo, I have uploaded several useful utility scripts for processing metagenomic reads. They are not fancy programs, just some scripts we used in our analysis frequently, and I think it would be helpful to share them, so it could save some effort for people who are doing similar research.

Please feel free to download and use any of those. I appreciate any comments and bug report.
